# AI Chat with Role-Based Database Access - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a role-based database access system for the Apexo AI chat functionality. This allows the AI assistant to access and analyze data from the database based on the user's role and permissions.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Data Access Service (DataAccessService.php)

-   Implements role-based access control for database queries
-   Contains methods to fetch tasks, meetings, employee information, and analytics
-   Applies appropriate filters based on user role (employee, manager, HR)
-   Handles data sanitization to prevent exposure of sensitive information

### 2. AI Tools Service (AIToolsService.php)

-   Defines the tools available to the AI based on user role
-   Maps AI tool calls to appropriate DataAccessService methods
-   Implements the interface between the AI and the database
-   Ensures tool calls are handled with proper permission checking

### 3. Enhanced PromptService

-   Updated to include role-specific information in the system prompt
-   Informs the AI about what data access capabilities are available
-   Generates different prompts based on user role (employee, manager, HR)

### 4. Enhanced ChatService

-   Integrates AI tools with the chat flow
-   Handles tool calls and processes their results
-   Maintains context across multiple tool calls
-   Stores metadata about tool results in message records

### 5. Test Data and Testing Tools

-   Created ChatAITestDataSeeder to populate the database with test data
-   Implemented TestAIChatCommand for command-line testing
-   Added documentation for testing the functionality

## Security Measures

-   Role-based filtering on all database queries
-   Data sanitization based on user permissions
-   No direct SQL access from the AI
-   All database interactions go through service layer with permission checks
-   Metadata storage for audit trails

## Usage Instructions

-   Set up the necessary environment variables for AI providers
-   Run the database seeders to populate test data
-   Test with different user roles (employee, manager, HR)
-   Follow documentation for sample queries to test the functionality

## Next Steps

1. Implement frontend integration with the enhanced chat functionality
2. Add streaming responses for better user experience
3. Implement additional tools for more advanced database interactions
4. Add analytics on tool usage and performance
5. Create user preference settings for AI data access

## Configuration Requirements

-   Prism PHP package configuration
-   OpenAI API key (or other providers)
-   Proper database structure with role information in the User model
